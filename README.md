## Roadmap

[] Allow to easily write Groups as basic arrays

[] Improve token resolving
    - Currently the token resolver always resolves the same tokens over and over.. Instead, we could store the resolved instance in an map, for example.

[] Add more tests.
[] Add variable interpretation when parsing.
[] Improve the State mechanism.
