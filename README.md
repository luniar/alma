## Roadmap

- [ ] Allow to easily write Groups as basic arrays
- [ ] Improve token resolving
    - Currently the token resolver always resolves the same tokens over and over.. Instead, we could store the resolved instance in an map, for example.
- [ ] Add more tests.
- [ ] Add variable interpretation when parsing.
- [ ] Improve the State mechanism.
- [ ] Make token expression easier to write
    - Using a regex fluent interface
    - Using a string that would later be interpreted
